# ![Falcon](logo.svg)

Falcon is a multi-process, multi-fiber Rack HTTP server built on top of [async], [async-io], [async-container] and [async-http]. Each request is run within a light weight fiber and can block on up-stream requests without stalling the entire server process. Supports HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 natively. [Paid business](#Business-Support) support is available.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'falcon'
```

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install falcon

## Usage

You can run `falcon serve` directly, and it will load the `config.ru` and start serving on https://localhost:9292.

### Integration with Rails

Falcon works perfectly with `rails` apps.

Add `gem 'falcon'` to your `Gemfile` and perhaps remove `gem 'puma'` once you are satisified with the change.

Run `RACK_HANDLER=falcon rails server` to start the server (at least, until [rack#181](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1181) is merged). Alternatively, if you want to use `HTTP/2`, run `falcon serve` directly.

### WebSockets

Falcon supports `rack.hijack` for HTTP/1.x connections. You can thus use [async-websocket] in any controller layer to serve WebSocket connections.

#### ActionCable

The `rack.hijack` functionality is compatible with ActionCable. If you use the `async` adapter, you should run falcon in threaded mode, or in forked mode with `--concurrency 1`. Otherwise, your messaging system will be distributed over several processes with no IPC mechanism.

### Integration with Guard

Falcon can restart very quickly and is ideal for use with guard. See [guard-falcon] for more details.

### Integration with Capybara

It's quick start up time is great for use with Capybara. See [falcon-capybara] for more details.

### Using with Rackup

You can invoke Falcon via `rackup`:

	rackup --server falcon

This will run a single-threaded instance of Falcon.

## Performance

Falcon is uses an asynchronous event-driven reactor to provide non-blocking IO. It can handle an arbitrary number of in-flight requests with minimal overhead per request.

It uses one Fiber per request, which yields in the presence of blocking IO.

- [Improving Ruby Concurrency](https://www.codeotaku.com/journal/2018-06/improving-ruby-concurrency/index#performance) â€“ Comparison of Falcon and Puma.

### Memory Usage

Falcon uses a pre-fork model which loads the entire rack application before forking. This reduces per-process memory usage. 

[async-http] has been designed carefully to minimize IO related garbage. This avoids large per-request memory allocations or disk usage, provided that you use streaming IO.
